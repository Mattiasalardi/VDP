# VDP (Venture Development Platform) - Project Context

## Project Overview
AI-powered application management platform designed for startup accelerators. Automates evaluation of hundreds of startup applications through customizable questionnaires and AI-generated assessment reports.

## Core Problem & Solution

### Problem
- Accelerators receive hundreds of applications per program
- Manual review is time-consuming and inconsistent
- Lack of standardized evaluation criteria

### Solution
- Automated initial screening through AI analysis
- Customizable questionnaires for data collection
- Standardized scoring and comprehensive reports
- Ranking system for easy comparison

## Key User Flows

### 1. Program Management & Setup (Multi-program per organization)
1. Staff logs into platform (single shared login per organization)
2. **Program Management Dashboard**: View all programs with statistics and completion status
3. **Create New Program** (unlimited programs per organization, e.g., "TechEd Accelerator 2024", "Healthcare Innovation Track", "AI/ML Program")
4. **Select Program** â†’ Enter program-specific workspace with independent:
   - Questionnaire Builder (program-scoped, max 50 questions)
   - Calibration Settings (program-specific preferences)
   - AI Guidelines Management (generated per program)
   - Application Management (program-isolated)
   - Reports & Analytics (program-scoped)
5. **Complete Program Setup** per program:
   - Build custom questionnaire for this specific program
   - Complete calibration questions about startup preferences for this program
   - AI generates scoring guidelines based on program-specific calibration
   - Review and modify AI-generated guidelines for this program
   - System generates unique application links for this program

### 2. Startup Application
1. Startup receives unique link (e.g., platform.com/apply/teched-2024/startup-abc123)
2. Fills out questionnaire (text, multiple choice, scale, file uploads)
3. Uploads PDF documents (generous size limit)
4. Submits application
5. System immediately processes application

### 3. AI Processing Pipeline
1. Extracts text from uploaded PDFs
2. Analyzes responses using pre-generated scoring guidelines
3. Generates scores for various criteria
4. Creates comprehensive PDF report
5. Stores everything in database

### 4. Review and Decision Making
1. Staff views generated reports in dashboard
2. Reviews scores, summaries, and highlighted concerns
3. Can override AI scores if needed
4. Ranks startups in sortable table for comparison
