- **Fixed Question Update Endpoint** (`questions.py:284-287`): Removed `.dict()` calls on dictionary values, proper response serialization
- **Fixed Question Get Endpoint** (`questions.py:192-204`): Added missing QuestionResponse serialization for single question retrieval
- **Simplified Question Schemas** (`question.py:57-58`): Changed from strict Pydantic validation to flexible `Dict[str, Any]` for options/validation_rules
- **Fixed Service Layer** (`questionnaire_service.py:116`): Removed reference to non-existent `question_text` field

**Frontend Integration Fixes:**
- **Real API Integration** (`api.ts:115-160`): Replaced all mock questionnaire methods with actual database API calls
- **Fixed Questionnaire Builder** (`builder/page.tsx:206-242`): Used real questionnaire IDs instead of hardcoded mock ID (1)
- **Field Mapping Consistency** (`builder/page.tsx:62-75`, `api.ts:119,142`): Proper mapping between frontend (`question_text`) and backend (`text`) field names
- **Program-Centric Navigation** (`questionnaires/page.tsx:10-12`): Removed global questionnaires access, enforced program selection
